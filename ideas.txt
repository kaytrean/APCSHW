~some sort of game?
      breakout
            hard coding maps? how many levels? powerups like extra lives, three balls at once, bombs inside objects
            6 levels, ball will get faster after hitting the bar 5 times, bricks you have to hit twice to break
            start off with 5 lives
            we need to keep score, different blocks for different scores
            powerups:
                  all bricks turn normal/ball can go through all bricks
                  extra life (only if one life already missing)
