Dijkstra's Algorithm 

Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm 
  Initialization : Start node in solution set
    use a heap to store weights from A to every node
    
    1. Grab node with lowest cost and add to solution set
    2. For each node in heap cost = min(oldcosts)
        cost to get t new node + cost from New node in solution set to this node)
